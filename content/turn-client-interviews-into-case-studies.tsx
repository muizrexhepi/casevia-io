        You finish a client interview feeling energized. The numbers were great,
        the transformation was real, and their story has all the raw material
        for a compelling case study. But once the call ends, reality hits:
        there’s nearly an hour of unstructured conversation — half of it
        tangents, repeated details, and off-topic moments. Turning that into a
        publish-ready asset suddenly feels like a full-time job.

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        This bottleneck is why most agencies and B2B teams struggle to produce
        case studies consistently. They know how valuable they are — often one
        of the highest-converting pieces of content in a sales cycle — but the
        creation process is slow, manual, and frequently deprioritized.

        In this guide, we break down a polished, repeatable, and scalable

        Why Client Interviews Are the Highest-Value Source Material
      </h2>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        A structured client interview contains everything a strong case study
        needs — if you know how to extract it. Interviews provide:

      <ul className="space-y-3 mb-8 list-disc list-inside text-zinc-700">
        <li>
          <strong className="text-zinc-900">Authentic language:</strong> Real
          words from real users resonate more than polished marketing copy.

        <li>
          <strong className="text-zinc-900">Emotion and context:</strong> Pain
          points, doubts, frustrations, and breakthroughs — the parts that make

          <strong className="text-zinc-900">Unexpected insights:</strong>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The only issue? Interviews are messy. Your job — or your system’s job —

        How to Execute This Process Efficiently
      </h2>

        Step 1 — Record the Interview (With Consent)
      </h3>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        In most cases, clients are more than willing to be featured. A simple,
        transparent framing works:
      </p>

      <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-zinc-300 pl-6 my-6 italic text-zinc-700">
        “Would you be open to us recording this so we can create a case study?
        It helps others in a similar situation understand what’s possible.”
      </blockquote>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-display font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-10 mb-4">
        Step 2 — Guide the Conversation
      </h3>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Strong interviews are intentional. Use questions that elicit the story
        arc:
      </p>

      <ul className="space-y-2 mb-6 list-disc list-inside text-zinc-700">
        <li>“What was going on before we worked together?”</li>
        <li>“What was your biggest hesitation?”</li>
        <li>“What stood out compared to past solutions?”</li>
        <li>“When did you first feel confident this would work?”</li>
        <li>“What specific results have you seen?”</li>
        <li>“How has this changed your team or workflow?”</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-display font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-10 mb-4">
        Step 3 — Extract & Structure the Story
      </h3>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Traditionally, this stage is where teams lose momentum — reading
        transcripts, pulling quotes, restructuring. It’s 8–12 hours of manual
        work.
      </p>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        A modern workflow automates transcription, highlights key moments, and
        organizes them into a narrative framework — reducing days of effort to
        minutes.
      </p>

      <ul className="space-y-2 mb-6 list-disc list-inside text-zinc-700">
        <li>A clear, outcome-focused headline</li>
        <li>Before/During/After narrative</li>
        <li>Quick results snapshot</li>
        <li>2–3 strong quotes</li>

        “Increased performance” isn’t persuasive. Specificity sells.

        <strong className="text-zinc-900">3. No emotional narrative</strong>
