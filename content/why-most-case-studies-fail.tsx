        You spend hours putting a case study together. You get quotes, pull the
        numbers, design it nicely, publish it… and nothing happens. Prospects
        barely skim it. It doesn’t get shared, and it doesn’t meaningfully move
        conversions.
      </p>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        And it’s not because case studies don’t work — it’s because most teams
        create them in a way that doesn’t match how people actually make buying
        decisions.

        First: Why Case Studies Work at All
      </h2>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Before we look at what breaks them, it’s worth understanding why case
        studies are such powerful sales assets in the first place.
      </p>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        At their core, case studies work because they tap into three things
        people naturally look for when evaluating a solution:
      </p>

      {/* SOCIAL PROOF */}
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-display font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-10 mb-4">
        1. Social Proof (People trust other customers more than your marketing)
      </h3>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        No matter how well you explain your product, prospects know you’re
        biased. But when a customer talks about what changed for them, it hits
        differently — it feels real.
      </p>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        A case study is essentially a testimonial with context. It shows the
        “before,” the “after,” and everything in between.
      </p>

      {/* PATTERN RECOGNITION */}
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-display font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-10 mb-4">
        2. Pattern Recognition (People look for someone like themselves)
      </h3>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Prospects want proof that people in their exact situation were
        successful with your product. If they can’t see themselves in the story,
        it won’t resonate — even if the results were great.
      </p>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        A founder struggling with churn cares about another founder struggling
        with churn, not an enterprise team that boosted ARR by $10M.
      </p>

      {/* EMOTION */}
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-display font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-10 mb-4">
        3. Emotion (People decide emotionally, justify logically)
      </h3>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Most case studies ignore the emotional part of the story — the
        frustration, stress, urgency, pressure, or ambition. But that’s what
        prospects connect with. The numbers simply confirm the decision they
        already want to make.
