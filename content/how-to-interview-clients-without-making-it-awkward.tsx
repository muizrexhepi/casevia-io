        Client interviews are one of the best ways to gather real insights and
        stories for case studies. But if you’ve ever run one, you know the
        awkward moments: long pauses, surface-level answers, or a client who
        keeps giving one-sentence responses.
      </p>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The good news? Great interviews aren’t about asking “genius questions.”
        They’re about creating a comfortable environment where the client feels
        open, safe, and unpressured. When you do that, the best stories come out
        naturally.
      </p>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Here’s how to run interviews that feel natural, valuable, and not
        awkward — for you or the client.

        1. Make It Feel Like a Conversation, Not a Questionnaire
      </h2>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The fastest way to kill the vibe is reading questions from a script.
        Clients start giving short, robotic answers because the tone feels
        formal.
      </p>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Instead, treat it like a casual conversation. Use your questions as
        prompts, not checkpoints. Follow wherever their story naturally goes.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-display font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-12 mb-6">
        2. Start With Easy “Warm-Up” Questions
      </h2>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Don’t jump straight into the problem or results. Start with questions
        they can answer without thinking:
      </p>

      <ul className="space-y-2 mb-6 list-disc list-inside text-zinc-700">
        <li>“How have things been going recently?”</li>
        <li>“What first led you to explore options like ours?”</li>
        <li>“When did you first realize this was a problem worth fixing?”</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Once they’re warmed up, deeper insights come out more naturally.
      </p>

      {/* SECTION 3 */}
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-display font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-12 mb-6">
        3. Ask for Stories, Not Answers
      </h2>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The best interview content comes from stories. People are naturally more
        descriptive when telling a story compared to answering a direct
        question.
      </p>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 font-semibold">
        Better prompts:
      </p>

      <ul className="space-y-2 mb-6 list-disc list-inside text-zinc-700">
        <li>“Can you walk me through what was happening at that time?”</li>
        <li>“Do you remember a specific moment when things clicked?”</li>
        <li>“What surprised you the most during the process?”</li>
      </ul>

      {/* SECTION 4 */}
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-display font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-12 mb-6">
        4. Don’t Rush to Fill Silence
      </h2>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Clients often need a few seconds to think. Most interviewers panic and
        jump in too quickly. But silence is where the good stuff usually shows
        up.
      </p>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 italic">
        If you give people space, they’ll go deeper.
      </p>

      {/* SECTION 5 */}
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-display font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-12 mb-6">
        5. Let Them Be Honest (Even If It’s Not Flattering)
      </h2>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The best case studies come from honest stories — including the moments
        when things weren’t perfect. If the client had doubts, struggled with a
        step, or wasn’t fully convinced at first, it’s okay. It makes their
        success more believable.
      </p>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        If they feel safe sharing the full picture, the story becomes stronger.
      </p>

      {/* SECTION 6 */}
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-display font-bold text-zinc-900 mt-12 mb-6">
        6. Ask Follow-Ups Instead of More Questions
      </h2>

      <p className="text-zinc-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Follow-up questions unlock depth. Instead of jumping to your next
        prompt, dig into what they just said:
      </p>

      <ul className="space-y-2 mb-6 list-disc list-inside text-zinc-700">
        <li>“What made that moment stand out?”</li>
        <li>“Why do you think that was such a big turning point?”</li>
        <li>“What was going through your mind at that point?”</li>
      </ul>

        A great interview doesn’t feel like an interview — it feels like a
        conversation. When clients are comfortable, honest, and unpressured,
        they’ll naturally give you the stories, details, and emotional depth
        that make case studies compelling.
